2) Open edit mode by clicking the pen icon in the top-right corner of the file display.
3) Find InfoBox part, also see more detailed editing instructions inside the file.
4) Make changes to the file.
5) Below the file, add an explanation for the "Commit", i.e. the changes. E.g. 'Add instructions for the UserPage'
6) Click the green Commit changes button at the bottom of the page.
7) Done! Inform toska that changes have been made so they can be pushed live.

## Setting up

Clone the repository.

Set up the database in a docker container.
Make a `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:

```
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:10
    ports:
      - '5321:5432'
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=disa
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev
      - POSTGRES_DB=disa_db
    volumes:
      - ./disa_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    container_name: disa_db
```

Start the container with command `docker-compose up -d`

In folders frontend, backend and kurki, run `npm install` in separate terminal windows or separate tabs.

In the backend folder, create a file called `.env` and add there these lines

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://disa:dev@localhost:5321/disa_db
KURKI_URL=http://localhost:3002
SECRET=<your own personal super secret>
NODE_ENV=development
TEST_DB_NAME=disa_test_db
```

Create a `.env` also in the kurki-folder, but only add the database parameters there:

```
DB_NAME=disa_db
DB_USER=disa
DB_PASS=dev
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5321
```

Create the database with the following one-liner (make sure the docker container is running):
`docker exec disa_db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE disa_db"` or try `docker exec disa_db psql --username=disa --dbname=disa_db -c "CREATE DATABASE disa_db"`

In the backend folder, run `node src/database/create_data.js` - *try it multiple times if it fails*!. You can also use a database dump. If you use a dump, run the anonymiser script with `node src/database/anonymise_data.js`.

To run all migrations type `npm run db:migrate` in the backend folder. You can roll back the most recent migration with command `npm run db:rollback`. _If you create a new migration, remember to run the migration command also on the staging and production servers. There is no automation to run these!_

Now just run `npm start` in separate terminal windows or separate tabs in folders: frontend and kurki, and `npm run start-dev` in the backend folder. The kurki-app is used for mocking logins. You can log in as any user in the database by simply entering the user-id as the username and `password` as the password.

Now you should have the project up and running.

## Running tests

### Frontend

Frontend tests should work without further configuration. Simply run `npm test`.

### Backend

Then create the test DB in /backend: `NODE_ENV=test npx sequelize-cli db:create --config conf-backend.js`

Now you can run `npm test` to run backend tests.
